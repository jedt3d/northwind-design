# Product Requirements Document (PRD) — Northwind Web App

> **Audience:** whole team · **Status:** complete (Phase 1, Cycle 1.2) · **Owner:** —

## 1. Product summary
A calm, clean, light-themed responsive web app for running Northwind Traders' daily operations — orders, purchasing, inventory, and the company/product master data behind them — in Thai, English, or Japanese. One shared database, five roles, every business rule enforced server-side.

## 2. Users & personas

- **Nok — Sales (desktop-heavy).** Takes phone orders all day. Needs fast order entry with stock visibility at the moment of entry, and the ability to register a brand-new customer without abandoning the order.
- **Ken — Purchasing (desktop).** Watches the low-stock list, turns restock suggestions into POs, chases expected dates. Wants suggested quantities computed for him.
- **Ploy — Warehouse (mobile-heavy).** Receives deliveries against POs and posts stock adjustments from a phone on the floor. Needs big targets, few taps, and numbers she can trust.
- **Suda — Manager (both).** Approves POs, watches sales and outstanding-PO reports, unblocks exceptions. Wants an approval queue on her dashboard.
- **Arthit — Admin (desktop).** Manages employees, roles, categories, and settings. Rarely daily, always precise.

## 3. Feature list & user stories
Priorities: MoSCoW. Wireframes: `docs/07-wireframes/NN-*`.

### F1 Login & language selection — Must
*As a staff member, I sign in with email/password and work in my own language.*
- AC: login with valid credentials lands on the dashboard; invalid shows an inline error; inactive employees are refused.
- AC: language switcher (th/en/ja) available on the login screen and top bar; choice persists across sessions (localStorage + profile).
- AC: all three languages render fully — no untranslated strings in core flows.
- Wireframes: `01-login`, `20-settings`.

### F2 Dashboard — Should
*As any staff member, I open the app and immediately see what needs my attention.*
- AC: role-aware panels — sales: my recent orders & orders stuck in New/Invoiced; purchasing/warehouse: low-stock products and POs awaiting receipt; manager: POs awaiting approval.
- AC: low-stock panel lists products with available < reorder level, linking to the reorder flow (F6).
- AC: recent items (orders/POs) replace the Access MRU list.
- Wireframes: `02-dashboard`.

### F3 Companies directory & detail — Must
*As a salesperson or buyer, I keep one directory of customers, suppliers, and shippers.*
- AC: list with search, sort, and type filter per docs/09 conventions; row click opens detail.
- AC: create/edit with multi-type, contact, address, tax id, website; validation inline.
- AC: type-in-use cannot be removed; delete blocked with a reason when orders/POs exist (BR-C1/C2).
- AC: detail shows the company's orders and POs.
- Wireframes: `03-companies-list`, `04-company-detail`.

### F4 Products & categories — Must
*As purchasing, I maintain the catalog the whole company sells from.*
- AC: product list flags low stock and mutes discontinued items; search/sort/category filter per docs/09.
- AC: product detail shows derived quantities (on hand, allocated, available, on order) and a Reorder action when below reorder level.
- AC: category management (name, description, image) for manager/admin.
- AC: discontinued products cannot be added to new orders.
- Wireframes: `05-products-list`, `06-product-detail`, `07-categories`.

### F5 Order management — Must
*As a salesperson, I create an order, watch each line allocate against stock, and walk it to Closed.*
- AC: create form defaults employee=me, date=today; lines pick product (searchable), qty; unit price auto-fills and is editable pre-invoice.
- AC: each saved line shows its status badge (allocated / no stock / on order); no-stock lines offer a "create PO" shortcut.
- AC: status buttons appear only when legal (Invoice requires all-allocated; Ship requires shipper+fee); server rejects illegal calls identically.
- AC: lines lock after New; unshipped orders can be cancelled/deleted; dates validate in order.
- Wireframes: `08-orders-list`, `09-order-create`, `10-order-detail`.

### F6 Purchase orders — Must
*As purchasing, I restock from suppliers; as a manager, I approve before anything is received.*
- AC: create PO manually or from a product's Reorder action (supplier and suggested qty prefilled to reach target level).
- AC: Submit → Approve (manager/admin only) → Receive → Close buttons gated by state and role.
- AC: receiving records date per line, posts purchased stock, and re-allocates waiting order lines oldest-first; affected orders update visibly.
- AC: cancel allowed any time before receiving.
- Wireframes: `11-purchase-orders-list`, `12-po-create`, `13-po-detail`.

### F7 Inventory — Must
*As warehouse staff, I see true stock and correct it when reality disagrees.*
- AC: on-hand view per product with below-reorder filter; numbers match the ledger sums exactly.
- AC: transaction ledger filterable by product/type/date; entries are read-only.
- AC: adjustment form takes signed quantity + mandatory comment; negative-result adjustments are rejected with a clear message.
- AC: all three screens comfortable at 360 px.
- Wireframes: `14-inventory-onhand`, `15-inventory-transactions`, `16-adjustment`.

### F8 Reports — Should
*As a manager, I check sales, stock, and outstanding purchasing without exporting anything.*
- AC: four reports — sales by period (by employee/product), top-selling products, stock on hand, outstanding POs — each with the date-range or filter controls it needs (default range: last 3 months).
- AC: every report pairs its chart (where present) with the numbers in a table; tables follow docs/09 conventions.
- Wireframes: `17-reports-home`, `18-report-view`.

### F9 Admin — Must
*As an admin, I manage who can do what.*
- AC: employee list/create/edit with role assignment and active toggle; deactivation blocks login immediately.
- AC: an employee with documents cannot be deleted — only deactivated.
- AC: settings screen covers language default and profile language.
- Wireframes: `19-admin-employees`, `20-settings`.

## 4. Out of scope (v1)
Dark theme; offline mode; external accounting/email integration; multi-warehouse and bin locations; partial shipments/invoices; returns & RMA; multi-currency; multi-vendor per product; Buddhist-calendar display; the Access print catalog and employee rosters.

## 5. Release plan
- v0.1-design → v0.2-backend → v1.0 (see PLAN.md cycles)

## 6. Metrics of success
- 100% of F1–F9 acceptance criteria demonstrably pass on production (`northwind.raawww.com`).
- Core flows (create order incl. no-stock path, approve+receive PO, adjustment) completable on a 360 px phone in all three languages.
- Zero business-rule violations reachable through the raw API in the verification test set.
- Wireframe verification gate (docs/07-wireframes/verification.md) passed with every feature mapped to ≥ 1 wireframe and vice versa.
