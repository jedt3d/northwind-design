# Data Dictionary & Database Description Guideline

> **Audience:** Database Administrator · **Status:** complete (Phase 1, Cycle 1.1) · **Owner:** —

## 1. Conventions (guideline for describing the DB)
- Collection names: `snake_case`, plural (`companies`, `order_details`)
- Every field documented as: name · type · required · default · relation · description · example
- PocketBase system fields (`id`, `created`, `updated`) assumed on every collection and omitted from the tables
- PocketBase types used: `text`, `number`, `bool`, `email`, `url`, `date`, `select` (enum; "select multi" = multiple values), `relation`, `file`
- Enum values are listed with meaning; allowed transitions are in §5
- Money fields are `number` in the base currency with 2-decimal convention; quantities are integers
- Currency: one base currency for v1 (display formatted per locale); no multi-currency fields

## 2. ERD (modernized from Northwind 2.0)

D2 source: `docs/diagrams/erd.d2` (embedded below; render with `d2 docs/diagrams/erd.d2 docs/diagrams/erd.svg`).

### 3.9 `inventory_transactions`
Append-only stock ledger; the single source of truth for quantities (decision #7). **No update or delete via API** (rules `null`).

| Field | Type | Req | Default | Relation | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| transaction_type | select (purchased, sold, on_hold, waiting) | yes | — | — | See semantics below | `purchased` |
| transaction_date | date | yes | now | — | When the movement happened | `2026-07-15` |
| product | relation (single) | yes | — | `products` | Product moved | `Chai Tea` |
| quantity | number | yes | — | — | **Signed convention below**; never 0 | `+100` |
| related_order | relation (single) | no | — | `orders` | Source sales order (sold / on_hold / waiting) | `SO-2026-0042` |
| related_purchase_order | relation (single) | no | — | `purchase_orders` | Source PO (purchased) | `PO-2026-0017` |
| comments | text | no | — | — | Mandatory for manual adjustments (BR-I4) | `Stock count correction` |

**Type semantics & signed-quantity convention.** `quantity` is signed so on-hand is a plain SUM:

| transaction_type | Meaning | Sign | Written by |
|---|---|---|---|
| purchased | Goods received on a PO, or a positive manual adjustment | **+** | PO receive hook / adjustment form |
| sold | Order invoiced (stock leaves), or a negative manual adjustment | **−** | Order invoice hook / adjustment form |
| on_hold | Stock reserved for an allocated order line (and its release: a matching + entry when allocation is freed) | − (reserve) / + (release) | Line allocation hook |
| waiting | Demand recorded for a no-stock line; zero stock effect, kept for restock reporting | 0-effect: excluded from on-hand sums | Line save hook |

### 3.10 On-hand derivation (the query)

Physical on hand (Allen Browne formula with the ledger as sole source — no stock-take baseline needed):

```sql
-- on hand: everything physically on the shelf (allocated stock still counts)
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) AS on_hand
FROM inventory_transactions
WHERE transaction_type IN ('purchased', 'sold')
GROUP BY product;

-- available to sell: on hand minus active reservations
SELECT product, SUM(quantity) AS available_to_sell
FROM inventory_transactions
WHERE transaction_type IN ('purchased', 'sold', 'on_hold')
GROUP BY product;

-- on order: quantity on approved, not-yet-received PO lines
SELECT pod.product, SUM(pod.quantity) AS on_order
FROM purchase_order_details pod
JOIN purchase_orders po ON po.id = pod.purchase_order
WHERE po.status = 'approved' AND pod.posted_to_inventory = 0
GROUP BY pod.product;
```

Via the PocketBase API the same numbers come from filtered list queries summed client-side or from a small custom route in `pb_hooks`; the low-stock flag is `available_to_sell < reorder_level`.

## 4. Business-rule constraints at data level
- Stock on hand is derived (queries above); hooks reject any transaction batch that would make on-hand negative (BR-I1).
- Status enums and their legal transitions (§5) are enforced in `pb_hooks` on update; the status fields are never directly editable in the UI (buttons only).
- Snapshots: `order_details.unit_price`, `purchase_order_details.unit_cost`, `orders.taxes` copy values at entry time and are never recomputed from the catalog.
- Referential guards: companies with orders/POs cannot be deleted (BR-C2); `inventory_transactions` and posted PO lines have delete rule `null`.
- PocketBase API rules per collection (summary; full strategy in docs/02 §5): all business collections list/view for any authenticated user; create/update per role — companies (sales, purchasing, manager, admin), products & categories (purchasing, manager, admin / manager, admin), orders + order_details (sales, manager, admin), purchase_orders + details (purchasing, manager, admin), inventory_transactions create (warehouse, manager, admin; plus hooks), employees (admin; self-view allowed), delete rules narrowest per module.

## 5. Status transition tables

### 5.1 `orders.status`

| From \ To | new | invoiced | shipped | closed | cancelled |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **new** | — | ✔ all lines `allocated` (BR-O2); sets invoice_date; writes `sold` + releases `on_hold` | ✘ | ✘ | ✔ frees allocations |
| **invoiced** | ✘ | — | ✔ requires shipper + shipping_fee (BR-O3); sets shipped_date | ✘ | ✔ reverses `sold` via compensating entries |
| **shipped** | ✘ | ✘ | — | ✔ | ✘ (BR-O5) |
| **closed** | ✘ | ✘ | ✘ | — | ✘ |
| **cancelled** | ✘ | ✘ | ✘ | ✘ | — |

Roles: invoice/ship/close/cancel — sales, manager, admin.

### 5.2 `order_details.status` (hook-managed, oldest-first reallocation)

| From \ To | allocated | on_order | no_stock | invoiced | shipped |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **none** (just saved) | ✔ stock available (writes `on_hold` −, `waiting` if partial flow) | ✔ approved PO covers it | ✔ nothing available | ✘ | ✘ |
| **no_stock** | ✔ on PO receipt / freed allocation | ✔ covering PO approved | — | ✘ | ✘ |
| **on_order** | ✔ on PO receipt (ReallocateInventory equivalent) | — | ✔ covering PO cancelled | ✘ | ✘ |
| **allocated** | — | ✘ | ✔ allocation freed (line edit while order still new) | ✔ order invoiced | ✘ |
| **invoiced** | ✘ | ✘ | ✘ | — | ✔ order shipped |

### 5.3 `purchase_orders.status`

| From \ To | new | submitted | approved | closed | cancelled |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **new** (draft) | — | ✔ purchasing+; sets submitted_date | ✘ | ✘ | ✔ |
| **submitted** | ✘ | — | ✔ manager/admin only (BR-P2); sets approved_by/date | ✘ | ✔ |
| **approved** | ✘ | ✘ | — (receiving happens here: lines get date_received, `purchased` posted, reallocation runs — BR-P4) | ✔ all lines posted_to_inventory | ✔ only if nothing received yet |
| **closed** | ✘ | ✘ | ✘ | — | ✘ |
| **cancelled** | ✘ | ✘ | ✘ | ✘ | — |

## 6. Seed & sample data policy
Seed data is adapted from the legacy Northwind dataset (northwind-pubs on GitHub, MIT; any file used is logged in `asset.md`): ~10 companies of each type, the classic product categories and a subset of products with prices/levels, 5 employees covering all roles, and a handful of orders/POs in assorted statuses so every workflow state appears in demos. Names/addresses are localized examples (Thai/English mix) rather than the 1990s US data; product and category images come from free sources logged in `asset.md`. Seeds live in `backend/seed/` and are idempotent.
